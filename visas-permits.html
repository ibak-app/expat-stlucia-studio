      <p>Most nationalities can enter Saint Lucia without a prior visa, provided they have a valid passport, onward travel, and sufficient funds. This is the starting point for most people who later decide to stay longer.</p>

      <h3 class="mt-24">Extending a Tourist Stay</h3>
      <p>If you wish to stay beyond your initial stamp, visit the Immigration Department on Laborie Street, Castries before your stamp expires. Bring:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Valid passport</li>
        <li>Return/onward ticket or proof of travel plans</li>
        <li>Bank statements or proof of financial sufficiency</li>
        <li>Proof of accommodation (lease or hotel booking)</li>

      </ul>
      <div class="tip-box tip-box--gold">
        <strong>Do Not Overstay:</strong> Overstaying your tourist stamp without an approved extension can result in fines, detention, and a ban on future entry. If your situation changes and you need to stay longer, address it immediately with the Immigration Department.

    <!-- Work Permit -->
    <div class="section" id="work-permit">
      <h2 class="section-title">Work Permits</h2>
      <p>Any non-CARICOM national who wishes to work in Saint Lucia must obtain a work permit before commencing employment. Work permits are employer-sponsored — meaning your employer (not you) makes the primary application.</p>

      <h3>Who Needs a Work Permit?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>All non-CARICOM nationals employed by a Saint Lucia business or individual</li>
        <li>Self-employed foreign nationals conducting business in Saint Lucia</li>
        <li>Contractors and consultants working on Saint Lucia projects for longer than 30 days</li>
      </ul>
      <p>CARICOM nationals with the CSME (Caribbean Single Market and Economy) skills certificate are exempt from work permit requirements.</p>

        <strong>Self-Employment:</strong> Foreign nationals who wish to be self-employed in Saint Lucia must apply for a work permit independently, demonstrating their business plan, financial capacity, and the benefit to Saint Lucia.

    <!-- Residency -->

      <h2 class="section-title">Long-Term Residency (Temporary Residence Permit)</h2>
      <p>After living legally in Saint Lucia for a period (typically while on a work permit), individuals can apply for a Temporary Residence Permit — also called a Long-Term Residence Permit — which provides more stability than annual work permit renewals.</p>

      <h3>Eligibility</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>Generally available after <strong>1–3 years</strong> of continuous legal residence</li>
        <li>Applicant must demonstrate ongoing ties to Saint Lucia: employment, property ownership, or business</li>
        <li>No serious criminal record</li>

        <li>Reference letters from established Saint Lucian citizens or community leaders</li>
        <li>Completed application form from the Immigration Department</li>
      </ul>

      <div class="tip-box tip-box--gold">
        <strong>Processing Time:</strong> Residence permit applications typically take 3–6 months. Apply well in advance of your current status expiring. An immigration attorney can significantly improve both your chances and timeline.

    <!-- Permanent Residency -->

          <p>After living legally in Saint Lucia for at least <strong>5–7 years</strong> (the specific period is at the discretion of the Chief Immigration Officer), individuals may apply for permanent residence. Requirements include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Demonstrated integration into Saint Lucian society</li>

        <div class="accordion__body">
          <p>Significant investors in Saint Lucia can apply for permanent residency on the basis of their investment. While the formal "Investor Residence" programme is distinct from the Citizenship by Investment programme, substantial property purchase or business investment creates a strong basis for residency approval.</p>
          <p>Investors who have purchased <strong>CBI-approved real estate</strong> (US$200,000–300,000+) may have an expedited pathway to residency as part of their investment portfolio.</p>

          <p>Saint Lucia's Retired Persons (Incentives) Act provides a residency pathway for those who can demonstrate a guaranteed minimum income from pension or annuity sources:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Minimum income requirement: approximately EC$40,000/year (US$14,815) from offshore/foreign sources — verified with current government</li>

            <li>Import one vehicle duty-free</li>

        <button class="accordion__header no-auto">Always Use an Immigration Lawyer <span class="accordion__icon">+</span></button>
        <div class="accordion__body">
          <p>For anything beyond a simple tourist stay, engaging a Saint Lucia-based immigration lawyer or consultant is money very well spent. They know the officers, understand current requirements, and can catch problems before they cause delays. Expect to pay EC$1,500–5,000 (US$555–1,850) for comprehensive immigration assistance.</p>

        <button class="accordion__header no-auto">Keep Certified Copies of Everything <span class="accordion__icon">+</span></button>
        <div class="accordion__body">
          <p>You will be asked for certified copies of your documents repeatedly — at the bank, at immigration, at the IRD, and at various offices. Get 5–10 certified copies of your key documents (passport, police clearance, work permit) before you start the process. Notarise them locally once you arrive if needed.</p>

        <button class="accordion__header no-auto">Follow Up Proactively <span class="accordion__icon">+</span></button>
        <div class="accordion__body">
          <p>Government departments in Saint Lucia can be slow to respond. A polite follow-up call or visit 2–3 weeks after submission is normal and expected. Ask for the name of the officer handling your case and note it for future reference.</p>

      <div class="accordion">
        <button class="accordion__header no-auto">Never Work Without a Valid Permit <span class="accordion__icon">+</span></button>
        <div class="accordion__body">
          <p>Working in Saint Lucia without a valid work permit is a criminal offence that can result in fines, deportation, and a multi-year ban on re-entry. If you are between permits, do not work. If your employer pressures you to start before the permit is approved, push back — it is your legal exposure at risk, not theirs.</p>

        <button class="accordion__header no-auto">Health Insurance Before You Arrive <span class="accordion__icon">+</span></button>
        <div class="accordion__body">
          <p>Immigration officials can and do ask for proof of health insurance, particularly for long-stay applications. Arrange international health insurance before departure and carry proof. It also protects you from potentially significant medical costs if anything goes wrong on arrival.</p>
