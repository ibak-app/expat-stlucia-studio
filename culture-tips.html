    <!-- Greetings -->
    <div class="section" id="greetings">
      <h2 class="section-title">Greetings &amp; Courtesy</h2>
      <p>Saint Lucian society is built on politeness, warmth, and respect. The greeting customs here are not optional social niceties — they are the foundation of every interaction. Getting these right signals that you respect the culture and see people as more than functional service providers.</p>

      <div class="tip-box">
        <strong>The Golden Rule:</strong> Always say "good morning," "good afternoon," or "good evening" before speaking to anyone — whether it is a shop attendant, a government officer, your neighbour, or a bus driver. Starting a conversation without a greeting is considered rude, regardless of how busy or hurried you are.
      </div>

      <h3>Time-Based Greetings</h3>
      <div class="table-wrap">
        <table>
          <thead>
            <tr><th>Time of Day</th><th>Proper Greeting</th><th>Notes</th></tr>
          </thead>
          <tbody>
            <tr><td class="td-label">Morning (until noon)</td><td>"Good morning"</td><td>Used even for brief interactions; always leads</td></tr>
            <tr><td class="td-label">Afternoon (noon–6pm)</td><td>"Good afternoon"</td><td>Never skip this for any interaction</td></tr>
            <tr><td class="td-label">Evening (after 6pm)</td><td>"Good evening"</td><td>Equally important; covers night-time too</td></tr>
            <tr><td class="td-label">General / casual</td><td>"How de body?" / "How you keeping?"</td><td>Casual Caribbean greeting; expect a warm response</td></tr>
            <tr><td class="td-label">Leaving</td><td>"Take care" / "See you later" / "Respect"</td><td>"Respect" carries genuine warmth in local usage</td></tr>
          </tbody>
        </table>
      </div>

      <h3 class="mt-24">Physical Greetings</h3>
      <p>In professional and formal contexts, a firm handshake is standard. In more casual social settings among people who know each other, you may see hugs, fist bumps, or cheek kisses between friends. As a newcomer, follow the lead of your Saint Lucian counterpart — let them set the physical greeting register. Do not rush to hug someone you have just met; a warm handshake and genuine eye contact is always appropriate.</p>

      <h3 class="mt-16">Asking After Family</h3>
      <p>Saint Lucian culture places enormous value on family. Asking about someone's family — "How's your family?" or "How's the children?" — after an initial greeting is a genuine mark of respect and interest. If you know a detail about someone's family from a previous conversation, reference it: "How's your daughter doing with school?" This kind of personal memory is deeply appreciated.</p>

      <div class="tip-box tip-box--green">
        <strong>The Transformation:</strong> Many expats report that the simple habit of greeting everyone properly — the petrol station attendant, the government clerk, the security guard, the market vendor — completely changes how Saint Lucia feels. The island becomes warmer, people become more helpful, and you feel more at home. This one habit is worth more than any social strategy.

    <!-- Island Time -->
    <div class="section" id="island-time">
      <h2 class="section-title">Island Time — Patience is Essential</h2>
      <p>"Island time" is a real cultural phenomenon in Saint Lucia, not a cliché. Time operates differently here — meetings start late, contractors appear when they appear, government processes take however long they take. Understanding this is not pessimism; it is the key to enjoying life in Saint Lucia rather than fighting it.</p>

      <div class="tip-box tip-box--gold">
        <strong>Cultural Note:</strong> Island time is not laziness — it reflects a culture that places relationships and quality of life above rigid scheduling. A Saint Lucian who stops to chat with a friend on the way to your appointment is not being disrespectful to you; they are simply operating within a different set of priorities. Adapting your expectations is not lowering your standards; it is respecting a different but equally valid way of living.
      </div>

      <div class="accordion">
        <button class="accordion__header no-auto">What to Expect from Appointments <span class="accordion__icon">+</span></button>
        <div class="accordion__body">
          <p>Whether it is a doctor's appointment, a tradesperson visit, or a business meeting, build 30–60 minutes of buffer time into your expectations. A meeting scheduled for 10am may begin at 10:30 or 11:00. This is not unusual and not a sign of disrespect.</p>
          <p><strong>How to handle it:</strong> Come prepared with something to do while you wait — your phone, a book, some work you can do offline. Do not sit and stew; arrive at the scheduled time and work while you wait. When the person arrives, greet them warmly without mentioning the delay — asking "what kept you?" can come across as aggressive in this context.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="accordion">
        <button class="accordion__header no-auto">Contractors &amp; Service Workers <span class="accordion__icon">+</span></button>
        <div class="accordion__body">
          <p>The contractor who promises to arrive "Monday morning" may arrive Monday afternoon, or Tuesday, or call and reschedule entirely. This is standard. The expats who manage this best are those who:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Ask for a specific time rather than a vague "morning" or "afternoon"</li>
            <li>Confirm the appointment the day before via WhatsApp</li>
            <li>Build buffer time into any project — add 50% to any estimated timeline</li>
            <li>Build relationships with reliable tradespeople (ask expat Facebook groups for recommendations)</li>
            <li>Pay promptly when good work is done — this builds loyalty and reliability over time</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="accordion">
        <button class="accordion__header no-auto">Government Offices &amp; Banks <span class="accordion__icon">+</span></button>
        <div class="accordion__body">
          <p>Government processes in Saint Lucia are genuinely slower than in most Western countries. Forms may be incomplete, referrals to other departments are common, and "come back tomorrow" is a frequent outcome. This is improving, but slowly.</p>
          <p><strong>Strategy:</strong> Always bring more documents than the list specifies. Come with originals and certified copies of everything. Be unfailingly polite and patient — the clerk you are dealing with has enormous discretion over how helpful they choose to be. Rudeness will almost always result in the minimum possible assistance. Warmth and patience often result in someone going out of their way to help you.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="accordion">
        <button class="accordion__header no-auto">Social Events <span class="accordion__icon">+</span></button>
        <div class="accordion__body">
          <p>Social events in Saint Lucia routinely start 30–60 minutes after the stated time. A party "starting at 7pm" really means people will begin arriving around 7:30–8:00pm. Arriving exactly on time for a dinner party or social gathering may find your host still preparing. Adjust accordingly, or check with the host privately if punctuality truly matters for the occasion.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="tip-box">
        <strong>The Mental Shift:</strong> The expats who struggle most with island time are those who resist it as a problem to overcome. The ones who thrive are those who accept it as a feature of the environment — like the heat, or the rain — and plan around it. Once you stop fighting it, you may find yourself appreciating the slower rhythm of life. That is, in fact, why many people chose to move here.

    <!-- Dress Code -->
    <div class="section" id="dress-code">
      <h2 class="section-title">Dress Code — Casual but Modest</h2>
      <p>Saint Lucia has a relaxed dress culture in tourist areas, but the local population is generally more conservative in dress, particularly in towns, government offices, churches, and formal settings. Getting this right signals cultural awareness and earns respect.</p>

      <div class="accordion">
        <button class="accordion__header no-auto">In Town (Castries and Commercial Areas) <span class="accordion__icon">+</span></button>
        <div class="accordion__body">
          <p>Castries is a working city, not a resort. Shorts and casual shirts are fine for shopping and errands, but swimwear, very short shorts, or bare midriffs are out of place and considered disrespectful by many local residents. Comfortable smart-casual attire is the right register for Castries.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Men:</strong> Shorts (knee-length or near), casual shirts, clean trainers or sandals — fine</li>
            <li><strong>Women:</strong> Light dresses, shorts and tops that cover the midriff, linen trousers — appropriate</li>
            <li><strong>Both:</strong> Swimwear, bikini tops, bare torsos — not appropriate in town</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="accordion">
        <button class="accordion__header no-auto">At Government Offices &amp; Banks <span class="accordion__icon">+</span></button>
        <div class="accordion__body">
          <p>Dress smartly for any official appointment. This is both a sign of respect and pragmatically useful — you are more likely to be taken seriously and receive efficient service when you look professional. Business casual is the standard: long trousers or a smart dress, a collared shirt, clean footwear.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Men: chinos or trousers, collared shirt (tucked or untucked), smart shoes or clean trainers</li>
            <li>Women: light dress or skirt below the knee, or smart trousers with a blouse; avoid overly casual or revealing clothing</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="accordion">
        <button class="accordion__header no-auto">At Church <span class="accordion__icon">+</span></button>
        <div class="accordion__body">
          <p>Saint Lucians dress beautifully for church — this is a point of pride and community expression. If you attend services, make the effort to dress well. For women, a dress or skirt below the knee with covered shoulders is appropriate for most congregations. Men should wear long trousers and a collared shirt at minimum; for Catholic masses and more formal services, a jacket is appreciated.</p>
          <p>Shorts, sleeveless tops, flip-flops, or casual beach wear will be noticed and is considered disrespectful regardless of your home culture's church norms.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="accordion">
        <button class="accordion__header no-auto">At the Beach &amp; Water Sports <span class="accordion__icon">+</span></button>
        <div class="accordion__body">
          <p>At designated beach areas and tourist resorts, normal beachwear is entirely appropriate. The line is simply: keep swimwear at the beach and pool. The moment you get in a car, enter a shop, or walk through a town — cover up with a sarong, shorts, or light shirt.</p>
          <p>Topless sunbathing is technically illegal in public spaces in Saint Lucia and is not socially accepted on public beaches. Private resort beaches may have their own more permissive policies.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="accordion">
        <button class="accordion__header no-auto">Carnival &amp; Festivals <span class="accordion__icon">+</span></button>
        <div class="accordion__body">
          <p>Carnival is the spectacular exception to all dress conservatism. The masquerade bands that "play mas" on the streets of Castries feature elaborate, colourful, and revealing costumes — this is entirely expected and celebrated as part of the tradition. If you are playing mas in a band, you dress as the band's costume dictates. If you are watching, comfortable casual attire is fine.</p>
          <p>Jazz Festival, La Rose, La Marguerite, and other cultural festivals each have their own appropriate dress — generally smart-casual to semi-formal for evening events.</p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>

    <hr class="divider" />

    <!-- Tipping -->
    <div class="section" id="tipping">
      <h2 class="section-title">Tipping</h2>
      <p>Tipping in Saint Lucia is customary but not the high-pressure expectation found in North America. The standard is generous by local wage standards and genuinely appreciated.</p>

    <!-- Kwéyòl -->
    <div class="section" id="kweyol">
      <h2 class="section-title">Kwéyòl — The Heart of Saint Lucian Culture</h2>
      <p>Kwéyòl (also spelled Creole or Patois) is the French-based Creole language that is the mother tongue of most Saint Lucians. While English is the official language and the language of education, government, and business, Kwéyòl is the language of the home, the heart, the market, and the community. Learning even a few phrases communicates genuine respect and effort.</p>

      <div class="tip-box">
        <strong>Why It Matters:</strong> Attempting Kwéyòl — even imperfectly — is one of the fastest ways to generate genuine warmth from Saint Lucians. It signals that you see them as more than English-speaking service providers, that you respect their culture, and that you have made an effort. You will be met with smiles, laughter, and encouragement every time you try.

      <h3 class="mt-24">National Creole Day</h3>
      <p>Saint Lucia celebrates National Creole Day annually on the last Friday of October as part of International Creole Day. On this day, Saint Lucians are encouraged to speak Kwéyòl, wear traditional Kwéyòl dress, and celebrate the language and culture. Expats who make any effort to participate — even just greeting everyone in Kwéyòl — will receive an enormously warm reception.</p>

      <div class="tip-box tip-box--green">
        <strong>Learning More:</strong> The Saint Lucia Folk Research Centre (FRC) produces Kwéyòl dictionaries and learning materials. Language classes are occasionally organised through community groups and appear in expat Facebook groups. Even basic conversational Kwéyòl classes will pay social dividends well beyond the language itself.

    <!-- Festivals -->
    <div class="section" id="festivals">
      <h2 class="section-title">Carnival, Festivals &amp; Cultural Participation</h2>
      <p>Saint Lucia has a rich festival calendar. Participating in these events — not just watching from the sidelines — is one of the most joyful ways to embed yourself in the community. These are not tourist experiences; they are genuine expressions of Saint Lucian identity.</p>

      <div class="accordion">
        <button class="accordion__header no-auto">Carnival (July) <span class="accordion__icon">+</span></button>
        <div class="accordion__body">
          <p>Saint Lucia Carnival is the island's biggest street festival, held in July. It centres on J'ouvert — the early morning "dirty mas" celebration where revellers cover themselves in paint, mud, and powder — followed by the main parade where costumed masquerade bands "cross the stage."</p>
          <h4>How Expats Can Participate</h4>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Play mas in a band:</strong> Register with one of the masquerade bands well in advance. You receive a costume, access to the band's truck with music, and an organised experience through the parade route. This is the most immersive way to participate. Bands advertise registration on Facebook from around January.</li>
            <li><strong>J'ouvert:</strong> The pre-dawn street party that starts Carnival Monday. Anyone can join — wear old clothes you do not mind ruining. The atmosphere is electric.</li>
            <li><strong>Watch the shows:</strong> Calypso Monarch, King and Queen of the Bands, Soca competitions — these are ticketed events held at the National Cultural Centre and the Rodney Bay grounds.</li>
            <li><strong>Etiquette:</strong> Be respectful of personal space in crowds. The energy is celebratory, not a licence for inappropriate behaviour. "Wining" (a Caribbean dance style) is part of the tradition but participate only when genuinely invited.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="accordion">
        <button class="accordion__header no-auto">Saint Lucia Jazz &amp; Arts Festival (May) <span class="accordion__icon">+</span></button>
        <div class="accordion__body">
          <p>The Saint Lucia Jazz Festival is a major Caribbean arts and music event drawing international headliners across jazz, R&amp;B, soca, and world music genres. Held primarily in May, the festival features outdoor concerts at Pigeon Island National Landmark and ticketed indoor events.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Main stage:</strong> Pigeon Island — stunning setting with the Pitons as a backdrop</li>
            <li><strong>Community concerts:</strong> Free or low-cost concerts in districts across the island during the festival week</li>
            <li><strong>Tickets:</strong> Purchase early — popular shows sell out well in advance</li>
            <li><strong>Atmosphere:</strong> Mixed local and international crowd; relaxed, inclusive</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

      <div class="accordion">
        <button class="accordion__header no-auto">La Rose &amp; La Marguerite Flower Festivals <span class="accordion__icon">+</span></button>
        <div class="accordion__body">
          <p>La Rose (August 30) and La Marguerite (October 17) are uniquely Saint Lucian cultural festivals with French Creole roots. They represent two rival folk societies — the Rose and the Marguerite — which stage elaborate celebrations including singing, dancing, and community feasts. These festivals are deeply embedded in local culture and less well-known internationally.</p>
          <p>Being invited to participate in a La Rose or La Marguerite celebration by a Saint Lucian friend is a genuine honour. Accept with warmth and participate with respect — these are not tourist performances.</p>

        <button class="accordion__header no-auto">Saint Lucia Independence Day (22 February) <span class="accordion__icon">+</span></button>
        <div class="accordion__body">
          <p>Saint Lucia celebrated independence from Britain on 22 February 1979. Independence Day is observed with parades, school ceremonies, cultural performances, and national pride. As an expat, acknowledging this day — even simply by mentioning it to your Saint Lucian colleagues and friends — is warmly received.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="accordion">
        <button class="accordion__header no-auto">Easter, Christmas &amp; Religious Festivals <span class="accordion__icon">+</span></button>
        <div class="accordion__body">
          <p>Saint Lucia takes religious festivals seriously. Easter is a major event — Good Friday is one of the quietest days of the year (many businesses close), and church services are packed. Christmas is celebrated enthusiastically with carol services, community events, and elaborate Christmas decorations from early December.</p>
          <p>Respect these observances even if you do not share the faith: keep music low on Good Friday, acknowledge Christmas warmly, and do not schedule important business meetings on major religious holidays.</p>

    <!-- Local Economy -->
    <div class="section" id="local-economy">
      <h2 class="section-title">Respecting Local Communities &amp; the Economy</h2>
      <p>Saint Lucia is not a wealthy country by global standards. GDP per capita sits around US$11,000 (2024 estimate), and employment challenges — particularly youth unemployment — are real. As an expat, your spending choices and economic behaviour have genuine community impact.</p>

      <div class="accordion">
        <button class="accordion__header no-auto">Understanding the Employment Context <span class="accordion__icon">+</span></button>
        <div class="accordion__body">
          <p>Work permits exist partly to protect Saint Lucian jobs — the government's position is that foreign workers should only be employed where no qualified Saint Lucian is available. This is not anti-foreigner sentiment; it is a reasonable policy for a small developing economy. Be sensitive to this when discussing work and employment.</p>
          <p>Saint Lucians are proud, hardworking people. Avoid generalisations about the local workforce, "island culture," or the pace of work that could be read as condescending — even if you have had genuinely frustrating experiences.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="accordion">
        <button class="accordion__header no-auto">Negotiating Prices <span class="accordion__icon">+</span></button>
        <div class="accordion__body">
          <p>Unlike some Caribbean islands, Saint Lucia is not primarily a bargaining culture. Supermarket prices, restaurant bills, and service fees are generally fixed. Light negotiation is acceptable in some contexts — craft markets, direct negotiations with contractors — but hard bargaining and aggressive price reductions are considered rude, particularly with small local vendors for whom the margin truly matters.</p>
          <p>Being known as the expat who always squeezes vendors on price is not the reputation you want. Pay fair prices, tip generously, and you will receive better service and genuine goodwill.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="accordion">
        <button class="accordion__header no-auto">Environmental Responsibility <span class="accordion__icon">+</span></button>
        <div class="accordion__body">
          <p>Saint Lucia's natural environment is its most precious asset — economically and spiritually. Littering, damaging coral reefs, taking protected wildlife, and disrespecting natural areas are not just legally problematic; they mark you as someone without respect for the island's identity. Participate in beach clean-ups, use reef-safe sunscreen, and model responsible environmental behaviour in your community.</p>

      <h2 class="section-title">The Essential Do's &amp; Don'ts</h2>
      <p>A quick reference for the most impactful cultural behaviours — positive and negative — for expats in Saint Lucia.</p>

      <h3>Do's</h3>
      <ul class="checklist">
        <li><span class="checklist__icon">✓</span><div><strong>Always greet first</strong> — "Good morning/afternoon/evening" before any request or conversation, without exception.</div></li>
        <li><span class="checklist__icon">✓</span><div><strong>Be patient with government processes</strong> — carry extra documents, arrive early, be unfailingly polite to clerks and officers.</div></li>
        <li><span class="checklist__icon">✓</span><div><strong>Tip appropriately</strong> — 10–15% at restaurants, EC$5–15 for guides, EC$2–5 for taxis on top of an agreed fare.</div></li>
        <li><span class="checklist__icon">✓</span><div><strong>Cover up when leaving the beach</strong> — a sarong, shorts, or light shirt when entering shops, walking through towns, or riding transport.</div></li>
        <li><span class="checklist__icon">✓</span><div><strong>Attend community events</strong> — street parties, Carnival, festivals, church events if invited — with openness and genuine participation.</div></li>
        <li><span class="checklist__icon">✓</span><div><strong>Try Kwéyòl</strong> — even one word of Kwéyòl earns immediate warmth. "Mèsi!" after any transaction is a great start.</div></li>
        <li><span class="checklist__icon">✓</span><div><strong>Support local businesses</strong> — markets, local restaurants, local tradespeople, local services wherever practical.</div></li>
        <li><span class="checklist__icon">✓</span><div><strong>Ask questions with genuine curiosity</strong> — Saint Lucians love to share their culture, history, and knowledge with people who are genuinely interested.</div></li>
        <li><span class="checklist__icon">✓</span><div><strong>Respect religious observances</strong> — Good Friday quiet, Sunday church dress codes, prayer time acknowledgements.</div></li>
        <li><span class="checklist__icon">✓</span><div><strong>Volunteer and give back</strong> — the expats most respected by the community are those who contribute meaningfully to it.</div></li>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="mt-24">Don'ts</h3>
      <ul class="checklist">
        <li><span class="checklist__icon checklist__icon--gold">✗</span><div><strong>Do not compare Saint Lucia unfavourably to home</strong> — "Back in the States/UK/Canada we do it this way" is the fastest way to create distance. You chose to be here; adapt with grace.</div></li>
        <li><span class="checklist__icon checklist__icon--gold">✗</span><div><strong>Do not wear swimwear in towns</strong> — particularly in Castries. It communicates disrespect for local culture and sensibilities.</div></li>
        <li><span class="checklist__icon checklist__icon--gold">✗</span><div><strong>Do not express impatience publicly</strong> — sighing, complaining loudly, or making scenes about delays at government offices or restaurants damages your reputation and achieves nothing.</div></li>
        <li><span class="checklist__icon checklist__icon--gold">✗</span><div><strong>Do not make assumptions about service quality</strong> — Saint Lucia has excellent professionals in every field. Enter every interaction without lowered expectations.</div></li>
        <li><span class="checklist__icon checklist__icon--gold">✗</span><div><strong>Do not bargain aggressively</strong> — particularly with market vendors, street food sellers, and small local businesses. Fair prices and generous tipping build goodwill.</div></li>
        <li><span class="checklist__icon checklist__icon--gold">✗</span><div><strong>Do not engage in political commentary</strong> — Saint Lucia politics is intensely partisan and deeply personal. As an expat without voting rights, publicly expressing opinions on local political parties is inappropriate.</div></li>
        <li><span class="checklist__icon checklist__icon--gold">✗</span><div><strong>Do not touch natural marine life</strong> — no touching coral, sea turtles, urchins, or any marine creatures. This is both illegal in protected areas and ecologically damaging.</div></li>
        <li><span class="checklist__icon checklist__icon--gold">✗</span><div><strong>Do not assume your way is better</strong> — approaches to cooking, parenting, community, religion, and business are different here, not inferior. Approaching difference with curiosity rather than judgement will define the quality of your experience.</div></li>
      </ul>

      <div class="tip-box tip-box--green">
        <strong>The Underlying Principle:</strong> Saint Lucians will forgive almost any cultural mistake made with genuine goodwill and humility. They will remember far longer any mistake made with arrogance or impatience. Come with warmth, patience, and a willingness to learn — and this island will give you more than you imagined.
