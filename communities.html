    <div class="section" id="where-expats-live">
      <h2 class="section-title">Where Expats Concentrate</h2>
      <p>Saint Lucia is a small island — 43 km long and 22 km at its widest — but the expat population is noticeably concentrated in a handful of areas. Understanding where your future neighbours are likely to be will help you choose where to live.</p>

      <div class="tip-box">
        <strong>The Reality:</strong> There are an estimated 2,500–3,500 long-term expat residents in Saint Lucia at any given time. The community is intimate — you will likely know a large proportion of them within your first year. That is both the beauty and the challenge of expat life on a small island.
      </div>

      <div class="accordion">
        <button class="accordion__header no-auto">Rodney Bay &amp; Gros Islet (The Hub) <span class="accordion__icon">+</span></button>
        <div class="accordion__body">
          <p>Rodney Bay is the single largest concentration of expats on the island. The marina, yacht clubs, restaurants, supermarkets, and international standard amenities make it the natural home for professionals, retirees, and yachties. Gros Islet, the town immediately north, is more local in character but heavily used by expats who want affordable rents with proximity to facilities.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Best for:</strong> Social life, dining, services, marina access</li>
            <li><strong>Typical rent (2-bed apartment):</strong> EC$3,500–6,000/mo (US$1,300–2,220/mo)</li>
            <li><strong>Vibe:</strong> Busy, international, good infrastructure</li>
            <li><strong>Key spots:</strong> Rodney Bay Marina, Baywalk Mall, Reduit Beach, the "Strip" restaurants</li>
            <li><strong>Community events:</strong> Friday Night Jump-Up in Gros Islet (weekly street party) is a great mixer</li>

        <button class="accordion__header no-auto">Cap Estate (Quiet Luxury) <span class="accordion__icon">+</span></button>
        <div class="accordion__body">
          <p>Cap Estate sits on the northern tip of the island and is Saint Lucia's most upscale residential area. Elevated, with ocean views from many properties, it attracts high-net-worth expats, retirees, and those seeking privacy and security. The Saint Lucia Golf and Country Club is the social anchor of this community.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Best for:</strong> Retirees, remote workers, golfers, privacy seekers</li>
            <li><strong>Typical rent (villa):</strong> EC$7,000–20,000/mo (US$2,600–7,400/mo)</li>
            <li><strong>Vibe:</strong> Quieter, more private, strong expat-to-local ratio</li>
            <li><strong>Key spots:</strong> St. Lucia Golf &amp; Country Club, Cap Maison resort area, Smugglers Cove Beach</li>
            <li><strong>Note:</strong> You will need a car — Cap Estate is not walkable for daily errands</li>

        <div class="accordion__body">
          <p>One of the most beautiful natural harbours in the Caribbean, Marigot Bay draws a different type of expat — sailors, artists, writers, and those seeking a slower pace. The bay is sheltered and stunning, with a small but loyal international community. Facilities are limited but the quality of life is extraordinary.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Best for:</strong> Sailing community, creative professionals, those wanting beauty over convenience</li>
            <li><strong>Typical rent:</strong> EC$4,000–10,000/mo (US$1,480–3,700/mo) for waterfront properties</li>
            <li><strong>Vibe:</strong> Laid-back, intimate, nature-first</li>
            <li><strong>Key spots:</strong> Marigot Bay Marina, Doolittle's restaurant, the bay water taxi</li>
            <li><strong>Downside:</strong> One road in and out — Castries is about 25 minutes by car</li>

        <div class="accordion__body">
          <p>Soufriere is the historic colonial capital of Saint Lucia and sits beneath the famous Piton mountains. The expat community here is small and tends to be made up of those who have truly committed to island life — often involved in eco-tourism, agriculture, art, or wellness businesses. Not for those who need international conveniences close at hand.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Best for:</strong> Those wanting an immersive local experience, entrepreneurs in tourism/wellness, people who love raw natural beauty</li>
            <li><strong>Typical rent:</strong> EC$2,000–5,000/mo (US$740–1,850/mo) — better value than the north</li>
            <li><strong>Vibe:</strong> Authentic, close-knit, connected to nature and local culture</li>
            <li><strong>Key spots:</strong> The Pitons, Diamond Botanical Gardens, Fond Doux Plantation, Jalousie Beach</li>
            <li><strong>Downside:</strong> 1.5–2 hours from Castries on winding roads; limited banking, shopping, and specialist services</li>

        <div class="accordion__body">
          <p>The capital city is not the most popular expat residential area — most expats prefer the quieter north or the scenic south — but it has the best access to government offices, banking, and commerce. Working expats in professional roles sometimes choose to live near Castries for the commute convenience.</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Best for:</strong> Working professionals, those needing daily access to Castries offices</li>
            <li><strong>Typical rent (city apartment):</strong> EC$2,500–4,500/mo (US$925–1,665/mo)</li>
            <li><strong>Vibe:</strong> Urban, busy during the day, quieter on weekends</li>

    <!-- Online Groups -->
    <div class="section" id="online-groups">
      <h2 class="section-title">Online Communities &amp; Facebook Groups</h2>
      <p>Social media is the main way expats in Saint Lucia find each other — especially before arriving. Facebook dominates social networking on the island, with WhatsApp groups for more immediate communication. Join these communities before you arrive and you will have a head start on social connections.</p>

      <div class="tip-box">
        <strong>Facebook First:</strong> Saint Lucia has very high Facebook penetration. The island's expat community primarily connects through Facebook groups rather than LinkedIn or Nextdoor. Joining the right groups before you arrive is one of the most valuable things you can do.

      <h3 class="mt-24">WhatsApp &amp; Other Platforms</h3>
      <p>WhatsApp group chats are how many neighbourhood and interest communities operate in Saint Lucia. Ask your landlord, neighbours, or new colleagues to add you to relevant groups — these are typically invitation-only. Once you are embedded in the community, you will naturally accumulate invitations to relevant groups.</p>

      <div class="tip-box tip-box--green">
        <strong>Pro Tip:</strong> When you join Facebook groups, introduce yourself properly. A short post saying who you are, where you are from, when you are moving, and what you are looking for generates a warm response from the community. Saint Lucians and long-term expats are genuinely welcoming to newcomers who approach with warmth and respect.

      <h2 class="section-title">Rotary Club, Lions Club &amp; Service Organisations</h2>
      <p>Service clubs are one of the best ways to integrate into the Saint Lucia community as an expat. They bring together local professionals and international residents around shared values of community service, and they offer genuine friendship rather than just networking.</p>

    <!-- Volunteering -->

      <h2 class="section-title">Volunteering &amp; Community Contribution</h2>
      <p>Volunteering is one of the most meaningful ways to integrate into Saint Lucian society. It demonstrates commitment beyond economic self-interest and builds genuine respect and friendship. Expats who give back tend to report higher levels of satisfaction and deeper social connections.</p>

      <div class="tip-box tip-box--gold">
        <strong>Important:</strong> Approach volunteering with humility. Ask what is needed rather than assuming. The most respected expat volunteers are those who listen, learn, and contribute in ways that genuinely serve the community — not those who arrive with a "I'm here to help" attitude that can come across as patronising.

    <!-- Building Relationships -->
    <div class="section" id="building-relationships">
      <h2 class="section-title">Building Genuine Relationships</h2>
      <p>This is the most honest section of this guide. Saint Lucia is a small, warm, and deeply relational society. Building genuine connections takes longer than many expats expect — but the connections you build are lasting and life-enriching. Here is what actually works.</p>

      <div class="accordion">
        <button class="accordion__header no-auto">Show Up Consistently <span class="accordion__icon">+</span></button>
        <div class="accordion__body">
          <p>In a small island community, trust is built through consistent presence. Go to the same rum bar, the same beach, the same church, the same market stall. The person who shows up every week eventually becomes a familiar face, then a known quantity, then a friend. Dipping in and out of community events without commitment rarely leads to deep connections.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="accordion">
        <button class="accordion__header no-auto">Learn People's Names &amp; Stories <span class="accordion__icon">+</span></button>
        <div class="accordion__body">
          <p>Saint Lucians notice and appreciate expats who take the time to learn their names, remember their family situations, and ask about their lives with genuine curiosity. This is a society where relationship comes before transaction. Don't rush to "the point" — take time to greet properly, ask how the family is, and listen to the answer.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="accordion">
        <button class="accordion__header no-auto">Support Local Businesses <span class="accordion__icon">+</span></button>
        <div class="accordion__body">
          <p>Shopping at local markets, eating at family-run restaurants, using local tradespeople and service providers — these choices build economic goodwill and genuine community ties. If you always shop at the international supermarket and never visit the street vendor outside, you will remain a stranger to most of the community. Spend your money locally where you can.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="accordion">
        <button class="accordion__header no-auto">Participate in Local Culture <span class="accordion__icon">+</span></button>
        <div class="accordion__body">
          <p>Attend the Friday Night Jump-Up in Gros Islet. Watch cricket at the Daren Sammy Ground. Join in Carnival. Eat the local food at Castries Market. Attend a community festival in Soufriere or Dennery. These participatory moments communicate respect and genuine interest in Saint Lucian culture — and they are genuinely wonderful experiences.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="accordion">
        <button class="accordion__header no-auto">Be Patient with "Island Time" <span class="accordion__icon">+</span></button>
        <div class="accordion__body">
          <p>Things in Saint Lucia do not always happen on the schedule you expect. Government offices are slower, contractors miss appointments, meetings start late. Expressing frustration with this — especially publicly — damages relationships and marks you as someone who does not understand the culture. Patience and good humour about delays earns you enormous respect. Impatience earns resentment.</p>
          <div class="tip-box">
            <strong>The Rule:</strong> Add 30 minutes to any agreed meeting time as your personal expectation. When things happen on time, be pleasantly surprised. When they do not, be gracious. This mindset change will transform your experience.
          </div>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="accordion">
        <button class="accordion__header no-auto">Expat vs Local Balance <span class="accordion__icon">+</span></button>
        <div class="accordion__body">
          <p>Some expats socialise almost exclusively within the expat bubble — the same Rodney Bay restaurants, the same marina parties, the same golf club crowd. This is comfortable but limiting. The expats who report the richest experience in Saint Lucia are those who have built a mixed social circle that includes Saint Lucians across different walks of life. Seek out these connections intentionally.</p>
        </div>
      </div>

      <div class="tip-box tip-box--green">
        <strong>The Long View:</strong> Give yourself 12 months before you judge whether you have found your community in Saint Lucia. The first three months are disorientation. By six months you are finding your feet. By twelve months, if you have been genuinely engaged, you will likely have friendships that will last a lifetime. This island rewards the patient and the genuinely curious.
